About:
=============
Cloussn is a simple Bookmarklet that you can add to your browser. It requires a valid CloudApp account & LESSN (I think minimum of 1.0.5).

This bookmarklet will tie CloudApp & LESSN together, allowing you to get the benefits of both services. When clicked, it first runs the URL of the page you are viewing through CloudApp, creates the bookmark, then takes that cld.ly link & finally runs it through LESSN.

=============
Requirements:
=============
Valid CloudApp Account and Valid LESSN install

=============
Installation:
=============
1. Drop the Cloussn folder anywhere on the internet.
2. Edit the Cloussn/config.php file with your respective CloudApp & LESSN info.
3. Then, visit the Cloussn/index.php in your favorite browser, drag the Cloussn link to your bookmark bar.
4. Click the bookmarklet on any page to make a coldly & lessn'd link.
5. Pat yourself on the back for being cool.

Special Thanks:
=============
Obviously, special thanks goes to the geniuses behind CloudApp & Lessn, without which this would be a useless piece of code.

Additional thanks goes to Matthias Plappert who created the CloudApp-API-PHP-wrapper that I used to easily interface with the CloudApp API. Thanks!
